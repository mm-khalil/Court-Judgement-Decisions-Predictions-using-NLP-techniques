**User Manuel**

This Manuel includes Steps, to perform that Natural Language Processing Project.

**STEPS:**

1\. Before working on project, you must have Installed, up, and running latest versions of

Anaconda, Libraries: Numpy, Matplot, Pandas, sklearnt, nltk, tensorﬂow, and seaborn.

2\. Then either download Dataset into your system or in code from Kaggle, as dataset

downloaded from many sources which all are menꢀoned in project report.

3\. Dataset needs to be Preprocessed, because it is gathered from many resources so it contains

misspellings, missing values, punctuaꢀons, it also needs up-sampling, shuﬄing etc. must be

removed and whole dataset must be in ﬂow, for that just follow the code provided in jupyter

notebook.

4\. Then ﬁnal dataset must be split into 70-30 raꢀo, for training and tesꢀng.

5\. Now implement algorithms:

I. Neural Network (Simple)

II.

Convoluꢀonal Neural Network

III.

Bi-Grams

IV. TD-IDF

V. RNN-Bidirecꢀonal LSTM

VI. Textual Embeddings

**Note:** Code for all these above-menꢀoned algorithms is given in Jupyter notebook ﬁle, and pdf

ﬁle contains output, graphs, visualizaꢀon, area under curve for each algorithm. You can see and

analyze from there that which algorithm give us best performance.
